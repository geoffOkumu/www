story: >-
  At first, I intended to be a physiotherapist. I went to university fully committed to doing just that. One thing led to another, two years went by and I was almost a fully-fledged freelance Frontend Developer. I had discovered my deep passion for technology and programming. I took a gap year to explore my passion and never looked back since. This fortunate turn of events has led me to develop websites for various clients, develop a successful SaaS product and publish an app to the play store.
